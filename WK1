p.8
Private: only accessible within the class
Public: accessible from anywhere (within, outside class, package, etc)

p.10
- each class needs a JavaDoc comment describing its purpose
- fields, methods, args should be well named.

p.12
- every type is a Primitive or Object
- type char is unicode (2 bytes/char): allows multilingual support and escape sequences
- type boolean holds true or false

p.13
- type Promotion (smaller -> larger)
- implicit conversion is ok

Type Demotion (larger -> smaller)
- need to type case or else might lose data (will throw error)
- TIP: default is double, need to type cast to float if required

Constants use type final ie. final int KAPPA = 1337;
- no magic nums

p.14
- = assignment on an object copies reference
- both objects with reference the same object
- both `phoneMsg` and `emailMsg` reference the new `GreetingsSelf` object
- setters affect the same object

p.17
- static method can be called on the class aka. class method
- static field shared by all class instances aka. class data
- no static local in Java

p.18 code demo
- static method cannot access non static field/method

p.19
- some errors throws exception (default behavior)
- custom exceptions ie. `throw new RuntimeException("some warning")`
